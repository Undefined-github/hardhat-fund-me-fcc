# Hardhat FundMe

## About
This is an example project with a contract that lets people fund, and the owner of the contract to withdraw the funded assets.

## Some Things You Need Before Starting
1. Yarn
2. Hardhat
3. This project(download it from this github repository)
4. Node.js(I'm not sure, but I think you need it)
5. Other things I installed with yarn like solidity-coverage, solhint(solidity linter), prettier, and prettier-plugin-solidity

## How to Use
Basically, you need to run the scripts in the scripts folder to either fund the contract or withdraw from it.
I added two commands in the package.json(fund and withdraw) to make this process easier. Make sure you have your Hardhat localhost node running, and make sure to first deploy the FundMe.sol contract. There are also other commands at the bottom of the package.json file you can try out, like test, lint, and format. 

## Description of the Process Making This Project
It mostly went pretty smoothly, and I definitely enjoyed it a lot. However, there was a few problems that I ran into, like typing the variable developmentChains wrong(it took me a day to realise :)). And apparently, sometimes I was half asleep, so I didn't get all of the instructions.
